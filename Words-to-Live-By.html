<h1>Words to Live By</h1>

<p>The book of Alma is a demanding book. If you don't feel challenged by it—challenged to change your priorities, your everyday practices, and your worldly preoccupations—you probably have not understood it. Your understanding of scriptures is manifest in what you do in response to them, not what you say or think about them. In the end, an authentic understanding of scriptures has very little to do with being able to derive from them a rationally defensible theology.</p>

<p>—Mark A. Wrathall, <em>Alma 30-63: a brief theological introduction</em></p>

<hr />

<p>So if someone we care about seems distant from a sense of divine love, we can follow this pattern—by doing things that bring us closer to God ourselves and then doing things that bring us closer to them—an unspoken beckoning to come to Christ.</p>

<p>—Elder Karl D. Hirst, “God’s Favourite”</p>

<hr />

<p>By arguing that thinking was a function of Being, Heidegger had tried to divorce thinking from the will in order to argue that it was one’s true inner Being that determined ultimately who they became in the world. But for Arendt, this was an abdication of personal responsibility and choice. It was a way of handing over one’s decision-making power. And for her, it is only the choices that we make in real time when confronted with decisions that determine who we will become, and in turn determine the kind of world that we will help to shape. . . .</p>

<p>Unlike ‘authenticity’, ‘willing’ is not a very desirable word. First of all, it’s not a thing one can possess, it’s an action, something one has to do. And unlike authenticity, there is no sense of comfort in ‘the will’. Authenticity promises certainty, whereas the will promises uncertainty. And in times of turmoil, it is all too human to prefer that which promises predictability to the unknown.</p>

<p>—Samantha Rose Hill, “Beyond Authenticity”</p>

<hr />

<p>The fundamental purposes for the exercise of agency are to love one another and to choose God</p>

<p>—Elder David A. Bednar</p>

<hr />

<p>Single-mindedness of this Sartrean or Savonarolan sort is the quest for purity of heart—the attempt to will one thing—gone rancid. It is the attempt to see yourself as an incarnation of something larger than yourself (the Movement, Reason, the Good, the Holy) rather than accepting your finitude. The latter means, among other things, accepting that what matters most to you may well be something that may never matter much to most people. </p>

<p>—Richard Rorty</p>

<hr />

<p>Faith is not faith if never tested. Faith is not strong if never opposed.</p>

<p>—Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf</p>

<hr />

<p>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it. But in connection with these, we believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost, the power of faith, the enjoyment of the spiritual gifts according to the will of God, the restoration of the house of Israel, and the final triumph of truth.</p>

<p>—Joseph Smith, <em>History of the Church</em>, 3:30</p>

<hr />

<p>To bear testimony means to declare gospel truths as inspired by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>—General Handbook, 29.2.2</p>

<hr />

<p>If you receive what the Lord’s Church offers, you can be perfected in Christ before His Church is perfected, if it ever is. His goal is to perfect you, not His Church. His goal has never been to, metaphorically, turn kieselguhr into diamond; His goal has been to refine you into pure gold, to save and exalt you as a co-inheritor with Him in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father. But that needs to become your goal, too. It is your choice.</p>

<p>—Elder Dale G. Renlund, 10/05/2024</p>

<hr />

<p>Those who do not see their weaknesses do not progress. Your awareness of your weakness is a blessing as it helps you remain humble and keeps you turning to the Savior. The Spirit not only comforts you, but He is also the agent by which the Atonement works a change in your very nature. Then weak things become strong”</p>

<p>—Henry B. Eyring, “<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9">My Peace I Leave with You</a>,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 16</p>

<hr />

<p>Jesus was “a man of sorrows,” the scriptures say. He experienced sadness, fatigue, disappointment, and excruciating loneliness. In these and in all times, Jesus’s love faileth not, and neither does His Father’s. With such mature love—the kind that exemplifies, empowers, and imparts—ours will not fail either.</p>

<p>—Jeffrey R. Holland, “I Am He”</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Be faithful and believe.</strong> Latter-day Saints often declare “I know” when they share their testimonies. These heartfelt expressions describe personal spiritual experiences obtained by studying and living the gospel. But we all walk by faith in this life. </p>

<hr />

<p>I am no longer a young man filled with energy and vitality. I am an old man trying to catch up with Brother Haight! I’m given to meditation and prayer. I would enjoy sitting in a rocker, swallowing prescriptions, listening to soft music, and contemplating the things of the universe. But such activity offers no challenge and makes no contribution.</p>

<p>I wish to be up and doing. I wish to face each day with resolution and purpose. I wish to use every waking hour to give encouragement, to bless those whose burdens are heavy, to build faith and strength of testimony.</p>

<p>—Gordon B. Hinckley, “Testimony”, April 1998</p>

<hr />

<p>Always think of what is useful and not what is beautiful. Beauty will come of its own accord.</p>

<p>—Nikolai Gogol</p>

<hr />

<p>Life isn’t out there. That’s not life. Life is what you do in here with what’s out there. That’s what life is.</p>

<p>—<em>Model Strangers</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK-0R3NagZQ">link</a>)</p>

<hr />

<p>Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts with theirs. Comparing usually leads to negative outcomes, such as discouragement or pride. Comparing is also often misleading. What the Lord wants is your own best effort—for you to “serve him with all <em>your</em> heart, might, mind and strength” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p2#p2">Doctrine and Covenants 4:2</a>; emphasis added).</p>

<p>It is fair to say that the correspondent on the boat is trying to avert catastrophe. He does this not by asking the point of the shipwreck (since shipwrecks are apropos of nothing) but by seeing what purpose he can give it.</p>

<p>—Elisa Tamarkin, <em>Apropos of Something: A Histort of Irrelevance and Relevance</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Dear brothers and sisters, God is the source of all truth. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints embraces <em>all</em> truth that God conveys to His children, whether learned in a scientific laboratory or received by direct revelation from Him.</p>

<p>—Russell M. Nelson, “What Is True?”</p>

<hr />

<p>There is nothing easy or automatic about becoming such powerful disciples. Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in <em>every</em> thought. But when we do, our doubts and fears flee.</p>

<p>—Russell M. Nelson, “Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives”</p>

<hr />

<p>“I believe that among the greatest lessons we are to learn in this short sojourn upon the earth are lessons that help us distinguish between what is important and what is not. I plead with you not to let those most important things pass you by.”</p>

<p>—Thomas S. Monson, “Finding Joy in the Journey”</p>

<hr />

<p>All of us should avoid speculating about subjects on which little or nothing has been revealed, perpetuating unsubstantiated claims and rumors, and substituting personal opinions and experiences for the word of God. We individually should pay the price to learn and understand the doctrine and principles for ourselves by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>—David A. Bednar, “Teach to Build Faith in Jesus Christ, Elder Bednar instructs”, <em>Church News</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I knew not who was right or who was wrong and concidering it of the first importance that I should be right, in matters that involve<del>d</del> eternal consequences . . .</p>

<p>—Journal, 1835–1836, The Joseph Smith Papers, 23</p>

<hr />

<p>The size of your faith or the degree of your knowledge is not the issue—it is the integrity you demonstrate toward the faith you do have and the truth you already know.</p>

<p>—Jeffrey R. Holland, “Lord, I Believe”</p>

<hr />

<p>Listen to your conscience—revelation often begins there.</p>

<p>—Neil L. Andersen, “Heavenly Father Wants to Speak to You”, <em>Liahona</em>, March 2025</p>

<hr />

<p>I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. Be not partial towards them in love above many others, but let thy love be for them as for thyself; and let thy love abound unto all men, and unto all who love my name.</p>

<p>—Doctrine and Covenants 112:11</p>

<hr />

<p>Because I know that good inspiration is based upon good information . . .</p>

<h2>—Russell M. Nelson, “Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives”</h2>

<p>The stance alluded to here is that of the sage, capable of resisting the temptations of the knowledge he bears within him. “From day to day, you grasp more, but you are reluctant to <em>sum up</em>; as though it could ultimately be possible to express everything in a few sentences on some single day, but then definitively.” A few sentences, uttered at the right time—this, for [Elias] Canetti, would be the correct response to the compulsion of the system, which madness and power and art and science are forever passing down to one another.</p>

<p>—W. G. Sebald, <em>Silent Catastrophes</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Yet down through history many have simplified, even trivialized our image of Him and His witness of who He was. They have reduced His righteousness to mere prudishness, His justice to mere anger, His mercy to mere permissiveness. We must not be guilty of such simplistic versions of Him that conveniently ignore teachings we find uncomfortable. This “dumbing down” has been true even regarding His ultimate defining virtue, His love.</p>

<p>During His mortal mission, Jesus taught that there were two great commandments. They have been taught in this conference and will forever be taught: “Love the Lord thy God [and] love thy neighbour as thyself.” If we are to follow the Savior faithfully in these two crucial and inextricably linked rules, we ought to hold firmly to what He <em>actually</em> said. And what He <em>actually</em> said was, “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” On that same evening, He said we were to “love one another; as I have loved you.”</p>

<p>—Jeffrey R. Holland, “I Am He”</p>

<hr />

<p>Why are our days of despair labeled by one as “vanity of vanities”? How is it that “vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men” are the words that characterize the great and spacious building, so spiritually dead in Lehi’s vision? And the Zoramites, that group who prayed so self-servingly? Of them Alma said, “O God, they [pray] unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up … with the vain things of the world.”</p>

<p>By contrast, is there anything sweeter, more pure, or more humble than a child at prayer? It is as if heaven is in the room. God and Christ are so real, but for others later on, the experience can become more superficial.</p>

<p>—Jeffrey R. Holland, “As a Little Child”</p>

<hr />

<p>We need not feel anxious, because Jesus Christ will transform us so that we are ready to meet Him. As we consistently honor our covenants and keep the commandments, we gradually become, through His grace and blessings, more and more like the Savior. And as we do, we will be prepared for His Second Coming. As stated in 1 John 3:2–3:
“Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p>

<p>“And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.”</p>

<p>—Dale G. Renlund, “Personal Preparation to Meet the Savior”</p>

<hr />

<p>Yes — that T.S. Eliot quote is a beautiful and piercing summary of James’s mental finesse. The idea that <em>“no idea could violate it”</em> suggests a mind that doesn’t <em>submit</em> to ideas, or get flattened by them, but rather absorbs, refines, and displaces them in the service of perception and form.</p>

<p>T.S. Eliot’s phrasing — <em>“a mind so fine that no idea could violate it”</em> — suggests <strong>not anti-intellectualism</strong>, but a kind of <em>supreme tact of mind</em>: the refusal to become the servant of an idea, or to use fiction as propaganda.</p>

<p>James doesn’t preach. He dramatizes. He shades. He veils.</p>

<p>—ChatGPT</p>

<hr />

<p>Our ultimate quest in life is to prepare to meet our Maker. We do this by striving daily to become more like our Savior, Jesus Christ. And we do that as we repent daily and receive His cleansing, healing, and strengthening power. Then we can feel enduring peace and joy, even during turbulent times. This is exactly why the Lord has implored us to stand in holy places and “be not moved.”</p>

<p>—Russell M. Nelson, “Opening Message”</p>

<hr />

<p>“I think our wisest plan is to do as we have done these many years,” he told apostle Melvin J. Ballard privately. “Accept all well-established and authenticated facts and refuse to base our faith on theories, whether scientific or theological.” . . .</p>

<p>The First Presidency reminded the quorums of Joseph Smith’s teaching: “Declare the first principles, and let mysteries alone, lest you be overthrown.” . . .</p>

<p>“While we magnify our calling in the realm of the Church,” they said, “leave geology, biology, archeology, and anthropology, no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific research.”</p>
